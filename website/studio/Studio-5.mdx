## Learning Objectives ðŸŽ¯
- Understand the current approaches that Singapore is taking to address issues about sustainable environment
- Understand that national- or urban-level directions, agendas and programmes affect the city at the lower levels of organisation, such as the district-level
- Understand how the nature of the problem a district or a city faces involves multiple stakeholders and urban systems
- Understand that improvements to each cityâ€™s approach to particular urban issues can be improved by learning from other cities: no one city has a monopoly on the best practices in urban development
- Understand that some approaches that each city takes cannot be translated to the contexts of other cities, because they do not operate well within a different context

## Tasks/Preparation ðŸ”¨
- Organise your proposal within a narrative framework, i.e., **â€˜whyâ€™, â€˜whatâ€™, â€˜howâ€™**. Consider the following:
  - Character of the district
  - How and why problems were chosen
  - How data was gathered
  - How analysis was conducted
  - Justification of proposed solution(s)
  - etc.
- The presentation should **incorporate the findings and feedback from all prior studios**
- Stakeholderâ€™s perspectives, challenges, and priorities should be clearly outlined
  - Does the solution better cater for stakeholders based on your teamâ€™s collected data?
  - What are the trade-offs, disadvantages, mitigation factors and compromises?

## Deliverables ðŸ“‚
- A deck of slides for presentationÂ 
_Discussion about Singapore case study:_

1.	Describe and explain the strengths and limitations of the current approaches adopted by Singapore to address the issues found within seminar topic of your choice 
Discussion about problems of allocated district:
2.	Identify a problem statement for the allocated district/a specific area in the district: problem statement should relate to the discussion about Singapore by analysing how Singaporeâ€™s approaches have been implemented in the allocated district/a specific area in the allocated district and how they can improve 
3.	Justify this identification of the problem statement with supporting evidence from site analysis and secondary research, including the use of 1 type of InVEST model of the choice of the team

_Discussion about proposed solution(s) for allocated district:_

4.	Describe and explain proposed solution(s) to address the problem statement 
5.	Show evaluation of solution(s) to assess the strengths and weakness of the solutions. Include discussion on how solutions are strong/weak based on how they impact and contribute to the national agenda/interest. To also include evaluation using 1 relevant kind of InVEST model.
Discussion about Jakarta case study:
6.	Describe and explain the strengths and limitations of current approaches adopted by Jakarta to address the issues related to the chosen seminar topic 
7.	Compare and contrast the similarities and differences in approaches between Singapore and Jakarta towards the same issues and why there are these similarities and differences.

The deliverables are to be synthesised into a **15-minute presentation** to be given by each of the teams.
