## Learning Objectives ðŸŽ¯
- Understand the current approaches that Singapore is taking to address issues about sustainable environment
- Understand that national- or urban-level directions, agendas and programmes affect the city at the lower levels of organisation, such as the district-level
- Understand how the nature of the problem a district or a city faces involves multiple stakeholders and urban systems
- Understand that improvements to each cityâ€™s approach to particular urban issues can be improved by learning from other cities: no one city has a monopoly on the best practices in urban development
- Understand that some approaches that each city takes cannot be translated to the contexts of other cities, because they do not operate well within a different context

## Tasks/Preparation ðŸ”¨
- Organise your proposal within a narrative framework, i.e., **â€˜whyâ€™, â€˜whatâ€™, â€˜howâ€™**. Consider the following:
  - Character of the district
  - How and why problems were chosen
  - How data was gathered
  - How analysis was conducted
  - Justification of proposed solution(s)
  - etc.
- The presentation should **incorporate the findings and feedback from all prior studios**
- Stakeholderâ€™s perspectives, challenges, and priorities should be clearly outlined
  - Does the solution better cater for stakeholders based on your teamâ€™s collected data?
  - What are the trade-offs, disadvantages, mitigation factors and compromises?

## Deliverables ðŸ“‚
- A deck of slides for presentationÂ 
- A maximum 15-minute presentation providing the pitch for the proposal
  - Problem statement
  - Analysis
  - Solution
  - Evaluation
