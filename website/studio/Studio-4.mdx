## Learning Objectives üéØ
- Understand that the crafting of urban solutions needs to be based on a robust understanding of the nature of the urban problems they are responding to, how the implementation of urban solutions impacts multiple stakeholders, and that refinement of the solutions in order to minimise stakeholder trade-offs is necessary
- Understand the tools that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed solution(s), including InVEST models
- Understand that some approaches that each city takes cannot be translated to the contexts of other cities, because they do not operate well within a different context

## Tasks üî®
- Conduct SWOT analysis in the perspective of different stakeholders within the team 
- Craft urban solution(s) in relative to the urban problem(s), using evaluation tool(s), including InVEST models

## Deliverables üìÇ 
_Discussion about proposed solution(s) for allocated district:_

1.	Describe and explain proposed solution(s) to address the problem statement 
2.	Describe and explain stakeholder trade-offs (with reference to stakeholders identified) caused by the proposed solution(s), if they were to be implemented 
3.	Describe and explain how you would refine the proposed solution(s) to minimise these stakeholder trade-offs
4.	Show evaluation of solution(s) to assess the strengths and weakness of the solutions. Include discussion on how solutions are strong/weak based on how they impact and contribute to the national agenda/interest. To also include evaluation using 1 relevant kinds of InVEST model.

_Discussion about Jakarta case study:_

5.	Describe and explain current approaches adopted by Jakarta to address the issues related to the chosen seminar topic (decided during the first presentation)
6.	Discuss the strengths and limitations of Jakarta‚Äôs approaches 
7.	Compare and contrast the similarities and differences in approaches between Singapore and Jakarta towards the same issues (hence incorporating the analysis of Singapore presented in the first presentation)
8.	Propose how Singapore can learn from Jakarta, and how Jakarta can learn from Singapore, in addressing the same issues, and where due to the uniqueness of each context, the transfer of expertise between the cities is not possible 

The deliverables are to be synthesised into a **10-minute presentation** to be given by each of the teams.
